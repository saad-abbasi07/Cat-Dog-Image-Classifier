# Cat-Dog Image Classifier

A simple image classification project that can distinguish between cats and dogs using a pre-trained CNN model (MobileNetV2). The model has been trained on 2000 images and is ready for prediction without needing the original dataset.

## Files

- `cat_dog_model.keras` : Pre-trained model file.  
- `predict.ipynb` : Example code to load the model and predict on new images.  

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/saad-abbasi07/Cat-Dog-Image-Classifier.git
